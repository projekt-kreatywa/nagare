ながれ / NAGARE is a hybrid investigation of the limits between Butoh dance and polyphonic traditional singing methods of Epirus (North Greece) accompanied by electric violin soundscapes.

Through the mixture of those two genres/styles ながれ / NAGARE creates a new form/technique which brings together Greek and Japanese performative elements. 

In short:

Butoh dance, polyphonic singing of Epirus (Northern Greece) laments and live electric violin, (55 min).
